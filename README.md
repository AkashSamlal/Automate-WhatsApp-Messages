# Automate-WhatsApp-Messages

I have a daily challenge with my friend whenever it is 11:11 or 4:20, we send each other a message saying the respected time. 

For instance if it is 11:10 am, I stalk my phone until it hits 11:11 am, and then I will send a 11:11 message, trying to beat her in the message war. However, I grew lazy as well distracted upon doing this, so I'm cheating my way by automating my WhatsApp messages, which this is the program.
